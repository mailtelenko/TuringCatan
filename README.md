# TuringCatan
The Settlers of Catan board game as a Turing program.

This was a final Engineering assignment.
Have fun I guess.

**Note**
You must hit the enter key after typing a name on the setup screen.
You can play with either 3 or 4 players, however to play with 3 you must click enter on the player 4 input field.
